# yalexide
An IDE for development of [yalex](https://github.com/AlexanderBrevig/yalexi) scripts.

Still very much a work in progress. Get in touch if you want to try it! I will help you get set up.

## Get the code and start to play

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AlexanderBrevig/yalexide
    cd yalexide
    cmake .
    make
    #start the executable!

## Contributions
This editor is heavily based on previous work done by [SSBMTonberry](https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/emu-jukebox) so a big thanks to him!
